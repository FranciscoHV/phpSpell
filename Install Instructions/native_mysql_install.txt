  You will need to modify the HTML in which ever program you use and add the following javascript & button:


   <script language='javascript' src='spelling/spellmessage.js'></script>
   <input type="button" class="" value="Spell Check" onclick="openspell();">

   You will also need to edit the Spellmessage.js file and change where the field links to on all four lines it is referenced.

Then you will be all done!
