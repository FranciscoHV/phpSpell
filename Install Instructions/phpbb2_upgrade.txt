This is only if you are upgrading phpbb version of the spellchecker from an much older version of the spell checker. 
This is a VERY important fix as this fixes the problem with OPERA starting the spellchecker.

You will have to modify your templates (Should be the last time ever! :). 

open up the posting_body.tpl and where I told you to put this line: 

<tr><td colspan="9" align="right"> 
     <input type="button" class="mainoption" value="SpellCheck" name="button" onclick="if(message.value.length)openspell();"> 
  </td></tr> 

--------------

Well we need to delete this part of it:
if(message.value.length) 

--------------

So it should actually read: 
  <tr><td colspan="9" align="right"> 
     <input type="button" class="mainoption" value="SpellCheck" name="button" onclick="openspell();"> 
  </td></tr>
